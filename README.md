# Introduction
This is a project for display 360 degree pictures on browsers. It's a real business case for a tourist company which want to introduce tourist spots in their platform with a VR solutions. Thanks to Aframe framework, I can create a VR sence easily on browsers, and it natively support mobile browsers with VR headset.

All the feature was written with module pattern, and use Webpack to bundle. After build and run, it will create a http server on your local machine, you can open the local browser to visit it at http://127.0.0.1:9000 or http://your_ip:9000 on your mobile browser to test the feature.

Here is a short video I recorded on my iphone so that you can have a quick view.
